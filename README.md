**I help developers learn OAuth and web security.**

Director of Engineering at ClearBank, web security consultant, and Pluralsight author. I specialise in all things authentication, identity, OAuth, and OpenID Connect.

At ClearBank, I am the Director of Engineering for Payments, working with engineering teams who maintain ClearBank's UK and EU payment rails, API security, and Open Banking products.

While I am currently taking a break from the world of identity & web security to focus on my leadership skills, I still find myself helping with the world of API security and PSD2 initiatives at ClearBank. I also keep my hand in by offering consultancy services.

At 10x Banking, I was a combination of team lead and technical product manager, leading a team of experienced IAM specialists while also championing identity standards and helping with design & architecture. At Rock Solid Knowledge, I created identity solutions for customers and developed commercial IdentityServer products. This allowed me to play with older protocols such as SAML & WS-Federation, the rollout of industry standards such as OAuth and OpenID Connect, and upcoming technologies such as FIDO2.

I mainly work with C# and ASP.NET Core, but otherwise, I dabble with languages such as Kotlin, Go, and JavaScript.

I sometimes make an appearance on the speaking circuit, whether at user groups, conferences, or recorded.
