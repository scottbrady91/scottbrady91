**I help developers learn OAuth and web security.**

I'm a **Director of Engineering at ClearBank** and a **Pluralsight Author**. I specialize in IdentityServer and all things Authentication, Identity, OAuth, and OpenID Connect.

In my day job at ClearBank, I'm an Engineering Manager for one of the Faster Payments teams. I'm currently taking a break from the identity world to focus on my leadership skills.

Previously at 10x Banking, I was a combination of team lead and technical product manager, leading a team of experienced IAM specialists while also championing identity standards and helping with design & architecture. Before that, at Rock Solid Knowledge, I created identity solutions for customers and developed commercial IdentityServer products. This allowed me to play with older protocols such as SAML & WS-Federation and cutting-edge technologies such as FIDO2.

I mainly work with C# and ASP.NET Core, but otherwise, I dabble with languages such as Kotlin, Go, and Typescript.

I sometimes make an appearance on the speaking circuit, whether it's user groups, conferences, or recorded.
