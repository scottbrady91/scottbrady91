**I help developers learn OAuth and web security.**

**Identity & Access Control Lead** at Rock Solid Knowledge, **Pluralsight Author**, and **Speaker**. I specialize in IdentityServer and all things Authentication, Identity, OAuth, and OpenID Connect.

In my day job, I create identity solutions for customers and develop commercial IdentityServer products. This allows me to not only play with older protocols such as SAML & WS-Federation but also cutting edge technologies such as FIDO2.

I mainly work with C# and ASP.NET Core, but otherwise, I dabble with languages such as Kotlin, Go, and Typescript.

I sometimes make an appearance on the speaking circuit, whether it's user groups, conferences, or recorded.
