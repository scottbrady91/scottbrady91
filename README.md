**I help developers learn OAuth and web security.**

I **lead the identity team at 10x Banking**, and I'm a **Pluralsight Author**. I specialize in IdentityServer and all things Authentication, Identity, OAuth, and OpenID Connect.

In my day job at 10x Banking, I focus on team and technical leadership, with a focus on identity. Previously, at Rock Solid Knowledge, I created identity solutions for customers and developed commercial IdentityServer products. This allowed me to play with older protocols such as SAML & WS-Federation and cutting-edge technologies such as FIDO2.

I mainly work with C# and ASP.NET Core, but otherwise, I dabble with languages such as Kotlin, Go, and Typescript.

I sometimes make an appearance on the speaking circuit, whether it's user groups, conferences, or recorded.
